Description: In computer experiments space-filling designs are having great impact. Most popularly used space-filling designs are Uniform designs (UDs), Latin hypercube designs (LHDs) etc. For further references one can see Mckay (1979) <DOI:10.1080/00401706.1979.10489755> and Fang (1980) <https://cir.nii.ac.jp/crid/1570291225616774784>. In this package, we have provided algorithms for generate efficient LHDs and UDs. Here, generated LHDs are efficient as they possess lower value of Maxpro measure, Phi_p value and Maximum Absolute Correlation (MAC) value based on the weightage given to each criterion. On the other hand, the produced UDs are having good space-filling property as they always attain the lower bound of Discrete Discrepancy measure. Further, some useful functions added in this package for adding more value to this package.
